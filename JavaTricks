Using redirects '<' and '>'. 
The redirect '<', takes the data from the System.in stream and puts it in a file. 

For example: 
when you run your java program: 
YouName$ java sort < data.txt 
 and your sort.java, you have a :
 java.io.BufferedReader stdIn = new java.io.BufferedReader(new java.io.InputStreamReader(System.in ));
 or
 Scanner input = new Scanner (System.in); 
 then, the data will be coming from the file data.txt to your program to process it or do whatever you want to do with it, maybe storing the data in data structure such as an array , or arraylist.
On the other hand, If you have the following redirect: 
YouName$ java sort < data.txt > out.txt
then in this case , if you have the follwoing line of code. 

System.setOut(System.out);

so, after finishing running the program, the the redirect will send the data from the file to the out.txt. it is a very useful tool.
